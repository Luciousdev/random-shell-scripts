# Random bash scripts

This is a collection of random bash scripts that I've made over the years. They're sort of categorized in the folders. Feel free to use them and maybe even support the project. 

Below will be a small tree of the things in the project. On each section you also have README files that will explain that specific section/script further.

NOTE: most of these work on all linux distro's but some scripts have features specific to said distro. Arch has pretty much the best 100% support but all scripts should "mostly" work on debian and fedora as well.
