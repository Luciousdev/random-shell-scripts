# Random bash scripts

This is a collection of random bash scripts that I've made over the years. They're sort of categorized in the folders. Feel free to use them and maybe even support the project.

Below will be a small tree of the things in the project. On each section you also have README files that will explain that specific section/script further.

* Fixes
  * Steam-blackscreen
* post linux install
  * arch
* Diagnostic
  * Log-file-analyzer
